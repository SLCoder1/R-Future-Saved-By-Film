 How have movies helped spread the word about our actions against the Earth?

To run this file, you must install python to be able to use pip functions. 
The next thing to keep in mind is that this program is quite large, and if you feel that it 
might be too much for you computer to handle, feel free to use python's virtual environment(python -m venv venv).
Next, for this assignment, we used ollama's llama3 model as a backend, so make sure to run pip install langchain-ollama.
Also install Flask(pip install flask) since this is the framework that helped us connect the frontend and backend files.
Install npm on your computer to be able to run our React files. In order to run the files, make sure you are in the directory
containing the react project, as it woudln't work otherwise, and run (npm run dev). Any other errors popped up can be resolved by installing any
missing files, and if your local host's don't seem to match, make sure to check the json files and other places where routing occurs.
Besides this, have fun exploring the ways movies of our country have displayed our effect on the Earth's resources! Make sure to talk with our chatbot
located in the bottom right of every page, and have fun!!
